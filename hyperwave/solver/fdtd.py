    r"""Execute the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulation method.

    Uses the convention that for :py:class:`State` at step :math:`i`, the
    :math:`E`-field is at time :math:`(i + 1/2) \Delta t` and the
    :math:`H`-field is at :math:`i \Delta t` (additionally, the current source
    :math:`J`, although spatially located at the :math:`E`-field locations, is
    temporally located at the :math:`H`-field points). Implements the update

    .. math::

        H^{i+1} &= H^i - \Delta t (\nabla \times E^i)

        E^{i+1} &= C_a E^i + C_b (\nabla \times H^{i+1} - J^i)

    where

    .. math::

      z &= \sigma \Delta t / 2 \epsilon'

      C_a &= (1 - z) / (1 + z)

      C_b &= \Delta t / (1 + z) \epsilon'

    and

    * :math:`\epsilon'` is the real-valued permittivity, and
    * :math:`\sigma` is the real-valued conductivity.

    Current source excitation is limited to a fixed complex-valued field pattern
    modulated by a complex-valued waveform such that the injected source is the
    real-part of the product of the field and waveform.

    Only subdomains of the :math:`E`-field are available as outputs, and these
    only at a set of regularly-spaced time points.

    This pure-JAX, feature-minimal implementation of the FDTD method also serves
    to identify the minimum set of features that subsequent simulation engines
    will require in order to serve the :py:func:`solve` API.


    Args:
        dt: Dimensionless value of the amount of time advanced per FDTD update.
        grid: Spacing of the simulation grid.
        permittivity: ``(3, xx, yy, zz)`` array of (relative) permittivity
          values.
        conductivity: ``(3, xx, yy, zz)`` array of conductivity values.
        source_field: ``Subfield`` describing the complex-valued simulation
          input.
        source_waveform: ``(tt,)`` array of complex amplitudes for ``source_field``.
        output_volumes: E-field subvolumes of the simulation space to return.
        snapshot_range: Interval of regularly-spaced time steps at which to
          generate output volumes.
        state: Initial state of the simulation. Defaults to field values of
          ``0`` everywhere at ``step=-1``.

    Returns:
      ``(state, outputs)`` where

      * ``state`` is of type :py:class:`State` and is advanced so as to fulfill
        the most advanced time step requested by ``snapshot_range``, and
      * ``outputs`` is a tuple of ``(nn, 3, xxi, yyi, zzi)`` arrays
        corresponding to the subvolumes identied in ``output_volumes`` and with
        ``nn`` as the number of snapshots as given by ``snapshot_range.num``.
